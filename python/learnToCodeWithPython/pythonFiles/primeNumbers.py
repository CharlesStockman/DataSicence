        Write a function that returns the first n prime numbers

        Input: The amount of prime numbers to be returned or the size of the list
        Output: A list of first prime numbers

        Did some research:
            6n + 1, 6n -1 it can be a prime, but produces a lot of false positives
            The list extends method can put each element of a tuple into the list as a single element

        Fact about Prime Number: Every prime number can be represented in form of 6n + 1 or 6n â€“ 1
        except the prime numbers 2 and 3, where n is a natural number.
